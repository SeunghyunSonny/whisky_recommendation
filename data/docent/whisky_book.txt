Ingredients
Making whiskey is actually a comparatively simple process using a
small number of ingredients. Yet the permutations of equipment,
practice, and raw materials allow for an incredible number of
variations in the whiskey that finally finds its way into the bottle.

peat
Peat is vegetable matter decomposed
by water and partially carbonized by
chemical change over thousands of
years. It is usually found in wetland
areas. The use of peat during the
kilning stage of malt production tends
to be limited largely to Scotland,
Japan, and occasionally Ireland.
Peat is added to the kiln fire to
provide what is known as ‚Äúpeat
reek‚Äù in order to promote phenolic
characteristics. The influence of
peat is most apparent in the single
malt whiskies of Islay.

production
Despite the variety of grains used and techniques employed, whiskey-
making the world over is remarkably similar. Its principal stages can
be boiled down to malting, mashing, fermenting, and distilling.

malting
This is the first stage of the malt whisky
distillation process in Scotland, where
only malted barley may be used.
In many other countries, whiskey is
produced using a variety of grains that
are not malted. However, a percentage
of malted barley is always used in
their production in order to promote
efficient fermentation.                              Not many distilleries still use old-fashioned

maturation
The influence of maturation in the creation of good whiskey cannot
be overemphasized. Indeed, some authorities consider that whiskey
acquires up to 80 percent of its final character in the cask. The cask
cannot make bad whiskey good, but it can make a good whiskey great.

the world, so distinct styles have emerged. These regional varieties are
often dictated by the most readily available grains, but they are also
based on climatic conditions and traditions too.

Talisker House and were soon encouraging the locals to emigrate to
make room for sheep, this being the time of the Highland Clearances.

and whisky business in Edinburgh. Proving to be an exceptional
entrepreneur, he had a growing reputation by 1837 and moved to
a prestigious address at the very heart of this prosperous city.

Edinburgh was one of the richest                   establishing blended Scotch as the
cities in the world at the time, and               leading international drink.

redistillation, infusion, or maceration. Today, whisky liqueurs are a

  Woodford‚Äôs Pepper and Crow
  Woodford Reserve traces its origins back to 1797, when Elijah Pepper
  moved from Virginia to Versailles, where he made corn whiskey in a
  small distillery behind the county courthouse. In 1812 he moved his
  operation to the present site on Glenn‚Äôs Creek in order to take
  advantage of the excellent supply of pure limestone water.
    Two years after Elijah Pepper‚Äôs death in 1831, his son
  Oscar hired Scottish-born chemist James Crow to work at the
  ‚ÄúOld Pepper Distillery‚Äù (later christened the ‚ÄúOscar Pepper
  Distillery‚Äù). The bourbon industry owes much to the work
  of Crow. He recognized the importance of consistency in
  whiskeymaking, perfected the ‚Äúsour-mash‚Äù process, and
  discovered the benefits of maturing spirit in charred oak
  barrels. Crow worked as head distiller for 29 years.

  The whiskey produced on the stills at
  Woodford Reserve became a favorite of
  writers Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, and
  of the 7th US president, Andrew Jackson.

Brands and Blends
Japanese blends have made a great impact internationally in the last
decade, winning acclaim and awards. Unlike distilleries in most other
countries, those in Japan do not trade with competitors, so one distillery
will produce a wide range of whiskies to make up its blends.

Distilleries and Whiskies
Asia has many distilleries, most of which produce ENA (extra neutral
alcohol) from molasses and other agricultural by-products (see p276).
Those selected here, however, focus at least part of their output on
whiskey made from barley or grain using traditional methods and ageing.
